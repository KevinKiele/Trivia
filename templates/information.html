<p>Locked up is a game where you need to answer trivia questions. The rules are simple:</p>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
        <p>- There is a singleplayer mode and a multiplayer mode. You can choose if you want to play alone or against other players to test out your intelligence!</p>
    </br>
    <br>
        <p>- The questions are divided in three categories: general, sport and history.</p>
    </br>
    <br>
        <p>- You have to choose your answer from four buttons. Three buttons have the wrong answer and one button has the CORRECT answer.</p>
    </br>
    <br>
        <p>- Every CORRECT answer rewards the player with 1 point. After a game the score will show up and in multiplayer the score will be compared. The player with the highest score WINS!</p>
    </br>
    <br>
        <p>- Your score will add up after every game and is shown on your profile.</p>
