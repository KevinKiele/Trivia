Welcome to the year 2047.

The once great race of humanity has diminished to but a select group of survivors left over from the Neverending War.
The survivors were divided in coallitions with the main aim to retrieve and secure the abandoned war treasures around the world.
Because weapons and war destroyed the face of the earth, the coallitions agreed upon never using weapons again, but instead turn to intellect to fight out their differences.
